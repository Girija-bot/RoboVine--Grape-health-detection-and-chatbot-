# RoboVine--Grape-health-detection-and-chatbot-
# Modern agriculture faces huge challenges
in maintaining crop health, improving yield, and reducing
losses due to diseases and mismanagement. This
project will make use of robotics, machine learning, and
computer vision in monitoring grape health
and field simulation for data-driven analysis. The system
integrates three-wheel robot simulation for the navigation
of a virtual field, a machine learning
model that classifies the condition of grapes, and a
chatbot interface for user-friendly
interactions. It aims to offer the farmer an integral solu
tion in grapevine monitoring and management.
